                Hello everyone, my name is Jonathan Pederzani and I attend Judson University in Elgin, IL.  I am married with two kids, a four year old daughter and 
                a two month old son, and we moved up here from Florida in December of 2019.  I've spent most of my life in Florida and never had the chance to 
                experience real seasons, and while I do miss warmth and humidity, I have come to appreicate the natural beauty of this state and its wilderness.
                I am a Computer Science major at Judson University with a minor in mathematics.
            </p>

            <legend style='font-variant:small-caps'><b>What I hope to learn in this course</b></legend>
                <p>
                    In this course I hope to learn how to develop and engineer applications that are easily extensible and upgradable.  Understanding how to utilize the 
                    internet, it's global reach, and existing infrastructure to produce applications that are current, viable, and efficient.  Learning how to manage the process of not 
                    getting bogged down in details, being flexible and able to pivot onto a new items as they arise, and staying focused on the overall goal despite short-term failings.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All of these things are important to me, from what I experienced as a technician at a small software company, has shown me the the fundemental principles of computer 
                    programming combined with the ability to recognize emergent technologies, capabilities, and trends to see where the industry is heading or should be.  These items are 
                    often overlooked by students because we want to learn how to program before we learn about efficiently and correctly programming.  However, is not one of the main tenants 
                    of software engineering and computer programming to use already existing work?  To benefit from the hard work of others so that we can spend more time innovating and 
                    creating instead of re-inventing the wheel?

        <legend style='font-variant:small-caps'><b>My favorite Hobby/Activity</b></legend>
            <p>
                Well I have a few of these items:
                <ol>
                    <li>My wife and children</li>
                    <li>Playing Guitar</li>
                    <li>Racing RC cars</li>
                    <li>Video Games <sub><em>(When there is time...)</em></sub></li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                I also like putting the kids to bed early on occassion and spending some time with my wife just watching out favorite TV shows.  Usually though, we just stare at our phones
                while the TV plays white-noise that isn't a kid's show.  It's the little victories that sustain you.

            <legend style='font-variant:small-caps'><b>Fun Fact</b></legend>
                <p>
                    I turn right on red arrows <i>(only when there is no oncoming traffic)</i>...

                    <!-- up here beacuse there are too many of them and not enough traffic to justify them.  Sometimes I laugh as I watch the car that was
                    behind me suffer as I just catch the every light right before it turns yellow and break free from the jaws of an extra ten-minutes on my commute.  I've heard 
                    the <q>right-turn on red</q> invention was the <q>best contribution the United States every made to the world.</q>  While I dispute that fact, I did notice that 
                    the United States does have the majority of the world's intersections where <q>right-on-red</q> turns are permitted, with the vast majority being in North America. 
                    That got me thinking, so I decided to collect some data and run some statistics to see if <q>red-arrows</q> at intersections were justified at all.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Because someone once described statistics as <q>Being a good math detective,</q> during my journey to collect this data I was attempting to figure out what data I would need
                    to collect to express my question sufficiently so that I could read the data correctly.  I knew the more pieces I found the more refined my question would become, and it was
                    this fact that gave me my first big break - everyone else but North America drives on the left side of the road.  My hypothesis needed modification, more specifically, I needed
                    make sure that the inverse of a right-turn on red was a left-turn on red, but to prove this I would need MOAR DATA!!!!-->

                    and I also like mathematics.  That's a fun fact that is uniquely me, right?  I really doubt anyone else likes mathematics in Computer Science.../s
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Something that is uniquely me <em><strong>AND</strong></em> is a fun fact about me would have to be my belief that infinity is omnipresent.

            <legend style='font-variant:small-caps'><b>Greatest Innovation</b></legend>
            <p>
                In my opinion, the three greatest acheivements in computing history would have to be:
                <ul style='list-style-type: square;'>
                <li>The invention of the silicone chip</li>
                <li>The creation of Object Oriented Languages</li>
                <li>The invention and distribution of the internet</li>
                </ul>
                Of these items I regard the creation of the internet and the ability to share and spread information, across the world, in an instant - well, I find that mind
                blowing to be honest.
