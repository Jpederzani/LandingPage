                            I've finished buffing out a few scratches and have it looking sleek enough for my liking.  Of course I'll be updating it throughout
                            semeseter, but for right now, it doesn't look too bad for coming out of 1998...

                                Currently I'm working on getting all this stuff put together, working, and looking nicely.  However things don't always go as 
                                planned, so here I am at 2:00AM, working on stuff that should have been finished long ago.
